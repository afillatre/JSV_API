##What does it do ?

In this demo, we show you how to interfere with the validation process. You have many breakpoints at your disposal :
* Before the validation occurs
* After the validation occurs
* Before the error messages are displayed
* etc.
 
## Important things to notice

This validation API provides a way to interact with a lot of thing during the validation's lifecycle. For example, you
can change an error message before it's rendered, or you can test whether the validation should be triggered at all
given your application state.

We tried to add as many breaking points as possible, so your only limit is your imagination
