{"name":"Jsv api","tagline":"","body":"### Why JSV_API ?\r\nWhen you create a website, you often have to deal with HTML forms. Those forms might need data validation, like :\r\n* check if a field has at least 5 chars\r\n* if an email is valid\r\n* and so forth...\r\n\r\nLong story short, this plugin allows you validate you data both on the client and the server side (if needed), with the _same rules_. But that's not all, you can add events on any part of the validation process, which makes the API suit a lot of needs.\r\n\r\nThe API contains several validation rules 'out-of-box', based on the Java JSR 303 (validation API), but you can extend them and create any new validation you like, in a blink of an eye.\r\n\r\n### Which problems does JSV_API solve ?\r\n#### Client-side validation\r\nDepending on what client-side framework you use, you may (or may not !) have a built-in validation API. While most of them may be great, you are sometimes limited to what you can validate. JSV_API lets you  create any kind of validation you need.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n* Project lead : @afillatre\r\n* First version main developer : @kjahan","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
